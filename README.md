    -V, --version              Print version information
```

## Installation

You will need to install [Rust] to compile `FSRT`. You can install `Rust` through [Rustup] or through your distro's package manager. You will also
need [Cargo], which comes by default with most `Rust toolchains`.[^1]
latest stable release, and adding the toolchain

[^1]: Cargo is technically not required if you want to download every dependency, invoke `rustc`, and link everything manually. However, I wouldn't recommend doing this unless you're extremely bored.

[Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/
[Rustup]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup "Rustup"
[Cargo]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo

Installing from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/atlassian-labs/FSRT.git
cd FSRT
cargo install --path crates/fsrt
```

or alternatively:

```text
cargo install --git https://github.com/atlassian-labs/FSRT
```

## Tests

To run the test suite:

```sh
cargo test
```

There are also two sample vulnerable Forge apps for testing. In the future these will be added to the test-suite, but
until then you can test `fsrt` by manually invoking:

```sh
fsrt ./test-apps/jira-damn-vulnerable-forge-app
```
